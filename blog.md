<p>Hey. I'm Sambath. I am a Mechanical engineer who is in love with everything that begins with data (and also Machine learning). Apart from having done my engineering, I am also a M.B.A graduate specialised in Operations from India. Most of my free time is made up of watching movies and TV-series, some amount of travelling and coding(mostly in python). </p>

<p> My interests are diverse, I literally love a lot of things like cars, movies, travelling, technology etc. But at the moment, I focus mainly on machine learning and deep learning technologies. If your thinking in the same way as me, I would love to talk to you by mail or LinkedIn (these details are in the homepage). </p>
